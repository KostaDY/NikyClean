## Section Summaries


### 2.1 From Code to Conversation
Semantic systems move beyond syntax and execution -- they are based on shared, evolving understanding between humans and intelligent agents.

### 2.2 Intent Over Instruction
Programming semantically begins with **what you mean**, not how you implement it.

### 2.3 Language as Interface
Natural language becomes the **primary design surface** -- a dynamic, generative programming interface.

### 2.4 Context as Computation
Context is part of the system’s logic -- built from memory, retrieval, and relevance, not just state.

### 2.5 Iteration as Dialogue
Refinement is not mechanical; it’s conversational. Systems learn and adjust through feedback loops.

### 2.6 Structure Emerges from Semantics
Structure isn’t imposed up front. It emerges in response to refined meaning and evolving requirements.

### 2.7 The Engineer as Curator and Collaborator
The role of the semantic engineer is not to code every rule, but to shape and refine a shared understanding -- acting as a guide, not a mechanic.

### 2.8 Traceability of Meaning
In semantic systems, traceability includes **intent history**, **clarification steps**, and **semantic versioning** -- all essential for trust and reproducibility.

### 2.9 Modeling the Other
Each agent maintains a model of the other. Human and AI co-evolve understanding by updating these models -- reflected in the clarified communication diagram (Figure 2.X).

### 2.10 Learning as Model Refinement
Learning isn’t static -- it’s embedded in the refinement of these models over time. Every clarification improves the system’s effectiveness and personalization.

### 2.11 Communication as a Semantic Product Engine
Communication is the **substrate of creation** -- a semantic workspace where proto-intents become clarified, iterated, and ultimately **realized as functional and documented output**.
